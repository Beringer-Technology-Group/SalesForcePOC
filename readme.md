Thank you for your interest in Beringer Technology Group.
I'd like you to provide a code sample that will show off your ability to develop in Azure.

Here's the requirements for your Function App:
- Written in c#, and using the latest version of .NET
- Timer triggerd, set to run every 30 minutes
- Query the SalesForce API, and return data in a JSON format.  Here is the SalesForece API documentation:  https://www.integrate.io/blog/salesforce-rest-api-integration/
- Store the JSON data in a service bus queue called DevTest.
- Document the function app in a Readme.MD file

There are sample credentials and connection strings in the local.settings.json file.
Please clone this branch, and upload your completed Visual Studio project to this repository.  I should be able to clone your branch, then compile and run your project.
Reach out to me with any questions.
Good luck :)
